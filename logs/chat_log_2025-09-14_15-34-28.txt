[user]
we are generating use cases for a food delivery app, similar to grubhub.
the goal is to create a minimum viable product.

use cases should have preconditions, a main flow, and alternative flows (error conditions).

please generate use cases for the following five scenarios:
1. customer searches for restaurants
2. customer updates their delivery address
3. customer cancels recently placed order
4. restaurant adds a new item to their menu
5. restaurant marks an item as 'out of stock'

Okay, here’s a breakdown of five use cases for a food delivery app, focusing on the preconditions, main flow, and alternative flows you outlined.  I’ve aimed for a balance of detail and clarity, considering a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) approach.

**1. Use Case: Customer Searches for Restaurants**

* **Name:** Search for Restaurants
* **Goal:** Allow the user to quickly find restaurants based on their criteria.
* **Preconditions:**
    * User is logged into the app or has a valid account.
    * User has a location set (or allows location access).
    * The app has a list of restaurants available.
* **Main Flow:**
    1. **User Input:** User enters a search term (e.g., "pizza near me", "Italian restaurant", "Sushi").
    2. **App Processing:**  The app utilizes the location data (if provided) to find nearby restaurants.
    3. **Display Results:** The app displays a list of restaurants matching the search term, ranked by relevance (based on distance, rating, etc.).  Each entry shows: Restaurant Name, Address, Distance, Rating, Estimated Delivery Time, and maybe a thumbnail image.
    4. **User Interaction:**  User clicks on a restaurant.
* **Alternative Flows:**
    * **No Results:**  If no restaurants match the search term, display a message like “Sorry, we couldn’t find any restaurants matching your search.”  Offer suggestions based on popular cuisines or nearby restaurants.
    * **Too Many Results:**  Display a ‘More Options’ button to broaden the search.
    * **Irrelevant Results:**  Display a ‘No Results’ message with a link to ‘Try a different search’ or ‘Browse by Cuisine’.

**2. Use Case: Customer Updates Delivery Address**

* **Name:** Update Delivery Address
* **Goal:** Allow the user to modify their delivery address.
* **Preconditions:**
    * User is logged into the app.
    * User has a valid account.
    *  Delivery address is saved (or the app can access the saved address).
* **Main Flow:**
    1. **User Input:** User clicks a “Change Address” button.
    2. **Address Input:**  A form appears with fields for:  Name, Address, City, State, Zip Code, Phone Number.
    3. **Validation:**  The app validates the input (e.g., correct format for zip code).
    4. **Confirmation:**  User reviews the updated address.
    5. **Save:** User clicks “Save” or “Submit.”
* **Alternative Flows:**
    * **Invalid Address:** Display an error message informing the user of the issues (e.g., "Please enter a valid zip code.").
    * **Incorrect Information:** The app attempts to correct the address and prompts the user to confirm the change.
    * **Address Not Found:** Display a message indicating that the provided address cannot be found.


**3. Use Case: Customer Cancels Recently Placed Order**

* **Name:** Cancel Recent Order
* **Goal:** Allow the user to cancel an order that has already been placed.
* **Preconditions:**
    * User is logged into the app.
    * User has placed an order.
    * Order has a status of “pending” or “processing.”
* **Main Flow:**
    1. **User Input:** User clicks a “Cancel Order” button.
    2. **Confirmation:**  A confirmation message appears stating, “Order Cancelled.”
    3. **App Processing:** The app checks the order status.
    4. **Cancellation Confirmation:**  If the order is still active, the app displays a cancellation confirmation screen with the order ID and cancellation reason.
    5. **Order Status Update:**  The order status is updated to “Cancelled.”
* **Alternative Flows:**
    * **Order Not Found:** Display a message like "Your order hasn't been placed yet."
    * **Order Already Cancelled:** A message stating that the order has already been cancelled and is removed from the order history.

**4. Use Case: Restaurant Adds a New Item to Their Menu**

* **Name:** Add New Item
* **Goal:**  Enable restaurant owners to add new food items to their menu.
* **Preconditions:**
    * Restaurant is registered and has a menu.
    * User is logged into the app (or has access to the restaurant's menu).
* **Main Flow:**
    1. **User Input:** User clicks a “Add Item” button.
    2. **Item Creation:** The app presents a form to input: Item Name, Description, Price, Category, Image (optional), and Dietary Information (optional).
    3. **Validation:** Validate the entered data (e.g., Price must be a valid number).
    4. **Save:** User clicks "Save" or "Submit."
    5. **App Processing:** The app validates the new item.
* **Alternative Flows:**
    * **Item Already Exists:** Display a message “Item Already Exists.” with a way to edit or delete the item.
    * **Invalid Input:** Display an error message explaining why the data is invalid.

**5. Use Case: Restaurant Marks an Item as ‘Out of Stock’**

* **Name:** Mark Item as Out of Stock
* **Goal:** Allow restaurant owners to quickly flag items as unavailable.
* **Preconditions:**
    * Restaurant has a menu.
    * User is logged into the app (or has access to the restaurant's menu).
* **Main Flow:**
    1. **User Input:** User clicks a “Mark as Out of Stock” button on an item.
    2. **Item Selection:** The app displays a selection of available items.
    3. **Item Selection:** User selects the item to mark as out of stock.
    4. **Confirmation:** The app confirms the action.
    5. **App Processing:** The app updates the item status in the restaurant's menu.
* **Alternative Flows:**
    * **Item Not Found:** Display a message for a missing item
    * **Item Already Out of Stock:** Display the message to the user.

**Important Considerations for MVP Development:**

* **Simplicity:** Focus on the core functionality (searching, updating address, cancelling).
* **User Experience:**  Prioritize a clean, intuitive interface.
* **Error Handling:** Implement clear and helpful error messages.
* **Testing:**  Start with basic testing to ensure the core flow works as expected.

To help me refine these use cases further, could you tell me:

*   What is the specific scope of this MVP? (e.g., just restaurant search and update, or just order cancellation?)
*   Are there any specific features you want to emphasize in the initial release?
